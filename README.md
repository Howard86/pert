# PERT

An online interactive PERT analysis built on next.js.

## Introduction

Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a method used to examine the tasks in a schedule and determine a Critical Path Method variation (CPM). It analyzes the time required to complete each task and its associated dependencies to determine the minimum time to complete a project. It estimates the shortest possible time each activity will take, the most likely length of time, and the longest time that might be taken if the activity takes longer than expected. The US Navy developed the method in 1957 on the Polaris nuclear submarine project.

## Purpose

PERT Analysis informs Program Managers and project personnel on the projectâ€™s tasks and the estimated amount of time required to complete each task. By utilizing this information a Program Manager will be able to estimate the minimum amount of time required to complete the entire project. This helps in the creation of more realistic schedules and cost estimates.

## Pros & Cons

Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing PERT analysis will give program managers and project personnel a better understanding of the realities of their schedules. It takes an experienced program manager to truly utilize the benefits a PERT analysis can provide a project team.

- Advantages: Provides Program Managers information to evaluate time and resources on a project. It helps give them the necessary information to make informed decisions and set a realistic schedule.
- Disadvantages: The analysis can be highly subjective and be influenced a few outspoken team members. It also required a lot of time to continually update the analysis as a program progresses.
